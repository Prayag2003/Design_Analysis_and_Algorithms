# MAKE YOUR OWN TIME TABLE

The Objective is to select such a Time Table schedule of different subjects such that a student can complete most of them as early as possible and in minimum days so as to Enjoy the Weekend :) 

Name of the Subject , Starting Time and Ending Time will be taken as inputs.

### CONCEPTS INVOLVED :- STL , SORTING 

A Vector Pair is used to store Starting Time and Ending Time together.
It is sorted in accordance to Ending Time so as to get maximum number of subjects in one day.
That being done , vector pair is iterated and those subjects' whose starting time is atleast equal to the previous subjects' ending time is counted and added into the maxSubjectsInOneDay .
